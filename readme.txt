== Special Notes ==

1)  If you leave out "folder", it prints out the WordPress root folder.  This will be fixed in future releases, please be careful for now.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's the secret code for displaying a list of files in my pages or posts? =

To use, add the List Yo' Files shortcode ("listyofiles") enclosed in brackets to the text of your page or post and specify the folder name with the "folder" directive.  For example:  [listyofiles folder="wp-content/gallery/my-new-gallery"]  The plugin will then generate a list of files with a link to each so that every file is downloadable.
